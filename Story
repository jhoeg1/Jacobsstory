Jacob woke up and had toast for breakfast. He went to class during the day and at night did his homework. After he finished the homework he went to bed because school is hard.

Next day, Jacob went to the birthday party to celebrate his best friend Sam's birthday. He bought him a book as present.

Sam opened the gift and really liked the book. This made Jacob happy because he knew he was a good friend to Sam

That weekend Jacob and Sam went to six flags to celebrate Sam's birthday and had a great time. It was Sam's first time there so Jacob showed him all the cool rides. They spent the whole day there and had a lot of fun.
